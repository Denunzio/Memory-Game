# Memory Game Project

Memory Game is a classic game that challenges players to memorize the locations of cards set out in a grid.

The goal is to match all pairs together with the same image.

How to Play Memory: 

The game starts with all cards facing down to create a rectangle on the table.
The player selects a card and turns it over, then selects another card if the two are
a match then the two card stay faced up.
If not a match then the cards will automatically flip over.

Object of the game: 

Is to match all cards has fast and quick has you can! You will be rated on stars if you have less than 12 moves you win 3 stars. If you moves are between 12 and 15 you recieve two stars and only one star after 16 moves.

Winning the game:

Once all the cards have been matched the player wins the game!
The winner score is based on stars three stars is the best and one star maybe try again!
